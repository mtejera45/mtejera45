### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Miguel Tejera
#### I am a Full Stack Web Developer

My journey as a programmer began in 2019, initially as a language assistant professor at the Ulsa Institute of Science and Technology, one of the most prestigious universities in South Korea. Being surrounded mostly by programmer colleagues and students, I developed an interest in programming and began attending courses and classes offered at this esteemed academic institution. 

Since then, I have specialized in Full Stack programming with a focus on the MERN stack, achieving several important milestones in my six years as a programmer. Among these achievements is a multi-tenant ecommerce application **https://www.instantdreamshop.com** that is currently in production and could potentially compete with giants in the specialized technology sector of e-commerce.


Skills: JAVASCRIPT / TYPESCRIPT / REACT / NODE.JS / EXPRESS / MONGO DB / REDUX / SOCKETIO / DOCKER / OTHERS 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on My own company Instant Dream Shop 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Jest

Check Out My Latest Project: Interactive No-Code Website Builder Application

I am excited to share my latest project, an interactive No-Code Website Builder application built with React and Vite. This application showcases some of my web development skills and my ability to create dynamic and user-friendly interfaces.

Why You Should Check It Out:

- Interactive Features: Add and manipulate elements like background images, stickers, and text on a canvas.
- Modern Tech Stack: Built with React and Vite, ensuring a fast and responsive user experience.
- Mobile and Desktop Views: Designed to work seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices.

While this project is a great demonstration of my technical abilities, it represents just a small part of what I am capable of as a programmer. I have a proven track record of developing and delivering much larger and more 
complex applications, such as my multi-tenant ecommerce platform, Instant Dream Shop.

I invite potential employers to explore the application and see firsthand the skills and expertise I can bring to your team. If you are looking for someone who can handle more significant and challenging projects, I am confident that my experience and dedication make me the right fit.
