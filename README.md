### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Miguel Tejera
#### I am a Full Stack Web Developer

My journey as a programmer began in 2020, initially as a language assistant professor at the Ulsa Institute of Science and Technology, one of the most prestigious universities in South Korea. Being surrounded mostly by programmer colleagues and students, I developed an interest in programming and began attending courses and classes offered at this esteemed academic institution. 

Since then, I have specialized in Full Stack programming with a focus on the MERN stack, achieving several important milestones in my four years as a programmer. Among these achievements is a multi-tenant ecommerce application **https://www.instantdreamshop.com** that is currently in production and could potentially compete with giants in the specialized technology sector of e-commerce.


Skills: JAVASCRIPT / TYPESCRIPT / REACT / NODE.JS / EXPRESS / MONGO DB / REDUX / SOCKETIO / DOCKER / OTHERS
